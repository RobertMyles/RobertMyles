### Rob McDonnell

I'm a manager of a data science team working in Ireland in the financial payments industry. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning 'MLOps', using GitHub Actions for data science tasks and learning about pipelines and data science project managers. 

Open-Source projects I've contributed to:
  - [tidyRSS](https://github.com/RobertMyles/tidyRSS), an R package to get and parse RSS feeds
  - [congressbr](https://github.com/duarteguilherme/congressbr), an R package to parse Braziian legislative data. Also contains some utility functions for political science.

A couple of my toy projects:
  - Print an XKCD comic to the RStudio plot window with [XKCDdata](https://github.com/RobertMyles/XKCDdata).
  - 🏉 [rugger](https://github.com/RobertMyles/rugger), and R package for rugby fans. 


I also blog sometimes at www.robertmylesmcdonnell.com. My site is open-source, I developed it using Gatsby.js, you can see the source [here](https://github.com/RobertMyles/site).
